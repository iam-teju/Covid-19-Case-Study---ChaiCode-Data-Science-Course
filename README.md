# COVID-19 Data Analysis Challenge

This repository contains the code and notebooks for a COVID-19 data analysis challenge completed as part of the Data Science course by Chaicode. It includes:

- **Data Cleaning**: Scripts to detect and impute missing values, reshape from wide to long format, and standardize date/column types.
- **Analysis Notebooks**:  
  - Peak daily new cases by country  
  - Recovery and death rate comparisons (e.g., Canada vs. Australia, provincial analyses for Canada)  
  - Monthly summaries for selected countries (US, Italy, Brazil)  
  - Merged “confirmed/deaths/recovered” dataset for combined visualizations

Feel free to explore the notebooks and reproduce the figures and summary tables.
